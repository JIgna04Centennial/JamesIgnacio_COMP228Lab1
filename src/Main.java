Description:
Write a Java application that creates a Java console application to keep records of singers and displays stored record. Follow the following instructions to develop the application:

Create a class named *Singers* with the following specifications:
 - *5 instance variables* that would store the following singer data (Use recommended variable naming conventions and appropriate data type for each instance variable):
    - Singer’s id
    - Singer’s name
    - Singer’s address
    - Date of birth
    - Number of albums published
    - *Several constructors* that would allow you to construct Singer object with no arguments, 1 argument, 2 arguments, 3 arguments, 4 arguments, and 5 arguments.

- Create *Setters* and *getters* for all the instance variables of class Singer. Make sure to have several setters that would allow you to set the values of individual instance variables of the singer object. Also create one setter that would allow you to set all the values of the instance variables at once. Create several getters that would allow you to get the current individual values of each instance variables of the Singer object.

- Create the *driver* class that would create 1 Singer (singer1) object with the help of the no argument constructor. *Display the default values* of the instance variables of this object singer1.

*Set the values of each instance variables with the help of setters*. *Display the values.*
